Swastik Eye Hospital â€” Minimal React Site

Overview
- Built with Vite + React + TypeScript
- Ultra-minimal, timeless design: fluid type, crisp contrast, generous whitespace
- Content integrated from `websiteinfo.md`; images sourced from `images/`

Getting Started
- Install: `npm i`
- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Preview build: `npm run preview`

Where to Edit
- Title/description and social tags: `src/Seo.tsx` and `index.html`
- Layout and sections: `src/App.tsx`
- Global styles and design system: `src/styles.css`
- Images: place in `images/` and import in `src/App.tsx`

Notes
- `websiteinfo.md` was used to populate meta tags, content sections, address, timings, and phone numbers.
- Social sharing image uses the high-quality ICL hero from your site.
- Design favors performance (system fonts, minimal JS, optimized assets).
