Review: Swastik Eye Hospital has some of the best doctors in Bangalore. I would highly recommend this hospital to anyone having some concerns with their eyes. When I went for my eye check up this year, they found that I my number had increased in the left eye. The doctors were really patient and helpful. They were able to talk to me well and tell me why the number increased and how I should take care of my eyes. The staff was also very friendly and helped me find the prefect lens and glasses for me with great ease. I was given the best guidance and found the people at the hospital to be very trustworthy. I would definitely come back for regular eye check ups.

Review: My father's cataract surgery was done by Dr. Kalpesh Jain. He is wonderful, both as a doctor and as a person; he listened very patiently, put my father at ease, explained all the things properly. The staff are also very courteous and helpful. The ambience of the hospital is good, and everything is on one floor.

Review: One of the worst eye clinic, they couldn‚Äôt digest the issue and provide wrong lens. That led to migraine and cause lot of tension. Patients are requested to take second opinion from different doctors before deciding the lens

Review: I am Rangarajan . R , a resident of Bangalore from 1985. I had my cataract done for the Right Eye, in 2011 from a good Eye Care Unit in Jayanagar. I had a chance meeting with Dr Kalpesh Jain after the surgery. From 2011 to 2018, I had been a regular visitor to check up the Left Eye Status for 8 long years with the remarks of post vision tests that the "Cataract is in the initial stages and not ripe for surgery". However towards the end of 2018, I have been advised to go for Cataract Procedure for the left eye as it is ripe and due. Without any delay I opted for the Cataract Surgery in Jan 2019. I value these interactions which have enhanced my confidence level. I feel proud to share my experiences post-Surgery for the benefit of intending fellow elders with perceived vision defects to be corrected to lead a better quality of life post treatment with improved vision. 1 From consultation to Cataract post-Surgery journey have been smooth. 2 Dr Kalpesh Jain‚Äôs narration during the course of procedure and courteous interaction is commendable as the patient is informed with the comfort level. 3 The instructions for the eye drops are well documented. 4 Subsequent to the Cataract procedure, the white acrylic frame is of good quality intended for 4 weeks and relatively comfortable during the constant use even during sleep. During bath, eyes are well protected from water drops and steam fumes dusts. 5 Rates are affordable as I Opted for Swastik Eye Hospital, after deliberation with other eye care providers in Bangalore. 6 The patients waiting hall is in a single relaxed floor without any obstructions to move around after eye drops and dilation. 7 Satisfactory level of ambient hygiene is observed during my short stay. 8 All enclosures are transparent and neatly organised resulting in an ideal visibility from the patients and the escorts perspective. I admire this eye level visibility. 9 The visibility of the patients is ideal for the escorts, as their movements can be effortlessly observed . 10 TPA ‚Äì Third Party Administrator faculty and their co-ordination is very much appreciated, as it minimises the stress level. Documents were given by me a week in advance to process the Insurance. The charges of Rs 650 is very reasonable. 11 Proximity to Gandhi Bazaar and Basavana Gudi eases the commuting stresses. 12 Doctor‚Äôs availability for consultation within the premises and the associated ease of interaction with the Doctor is very much appreciated. 13 The Integral Part of the Ophthalmic Unit is an added advantage for the patients, as a couple of adjustments are necessary during the initial stages for the comfort level. 14 Referrals: I have since successfully recommended a couple of my relatives to get the benefit of the treatment and they have voiced their appreciations for the care and leading a life with a better quality of vision. 15. During my interactions with a fellow patients, during my short stay in Swastik , I have observed a relaxed mind set of the patients for a better vision. I sincerely and whole- heartedly recommend elderly people with perceived defective vision to approach Swastik Eye Hospital and lead a quality life with improved vision. My best wishes Rangarajan Bangalore 06 Mar 2019
